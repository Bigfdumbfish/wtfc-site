      <p className="mb-4">
        Founded in 2024 by Dr. Quinton Wyatt, Wyatt Thin Film Company LLC (WTFC) was born from a desire to transform scientific breakthroughs into real-world solutions. With a doctorate in Material Science from the University of Missouri, Dr. Wyatt dedicated years to mastering atomic layer deposition (ALD) and molecular layer deposition (MLD) techniques—methods that enable the creation of ultra-thin, precise, and high-performance coatings. Recognizing the untapped potential of these techniques in addressing critical global challenges, Dr. Wyatt launched WTFC with a clear mission: to enhance water purification systems and energy storage technologies through advanced materials engineering.
